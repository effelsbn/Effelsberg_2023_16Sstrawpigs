# Pilot study on nasal microbiota dynamics and MRSA carriage of a pig cohort housed on straw bedding

This is a repository with data and scripts accompanying our manuscript "Pilot study on nasal microbiota dynamics and MRSA carriage of a pig cohort housed on straw bedding", which is currently under review.
* **pre-processing** contains the scripts to produce the ASV and taxa table from the raw reads (which are deposited at NCBI SRA under accession number **PRJNA905368**) using DADA2
* **data** contains metadata (including MRSA status) and all input files necessary to replicate the analysis, including ASV & taxa tables, a readtrack of the DADA2 pipeline and composition of the mock community
* **scripts** contains the code to generate the analyses and figures presented in the paper
* **paper** contains the RMarkdown file used to write the manuscript including code to calculate numbers
